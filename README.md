# Time_Series_Classification

The pytorch implementation of time series classification model in my personal understanding

mainly the models in [tsai](https://github.com/timeseriesAI/tsai)

including LSTM_FCN, MLSTM_FCN, GRU_FCN, mWDN, Rocket, TCN, XCM, gMLP, TabTransformer, GatedTabTransformer

some details may be different from the official code.
